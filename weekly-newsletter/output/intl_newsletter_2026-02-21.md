## The Week in Brief

International markets posted mostly gains this week, with MSCI EM (Emerging Markets) leading at +2.67% and Hang Seng (Asia-Pacific) lagging at -3.06%. European indices outperformed on average (+2.00%); Asia-Pacific lagged (-0.71% average); Emerging Markets (MSCI EM) moved +2.67%. On the FX front, the Euro weakened 0.82%, the Swiss Franc weakened 0.92%, the British Pound weakened 1.37%, and the Japanese Yen weakened 1.53%, all against the USD.

The macro picture was eventful. Japan Q4 GDP (Preliminary) came in below expectations (-0.4% vs. 0.3%). UK CPI (YoY) came in above expectations (3.1% vs. 2.8%). China Caixin Services PMI came in above expectations (52.3 vs. 51.8). The combination of sticky inflation and weak growth (a stagflationary signal) puts central banks in a difficult position and argues for a cautious stance on duration and rate-sensitive sectors.

Looking ahead, key events to watch are: BOJ Meeting Minutes, ECB Rate Decision, Eurozone CPI Flash (YoY). Central bank decisions in particular can drive sharp FX and equity moves; position sizing should reflect that risk.

## Last Week's Economic Events


### Japan Q4 GDP (Preliminary) (2026-02-17)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Actual** | -0.4% |
| **Expected** | 0.3% |
| **Previous** | 0.9% |
| **Surprise** | below |

**Investor Impact:** Japan's economy unexpectedly contracted in Q4, raising doubts about the BOJ's path toward policy normalization. Growth weakness undercuts the case for further rate hikes and may weigh on EWJ near-term.


### ECB Meeting Minutes (2026-02-18)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Actual** | -- |
| **Expected** | -- |
| **Previous** | -- |
| **Surprise** | neutral |

**Investor Impact:** Minutes showed broad consensus to hold rates steady at 2.75%, with most members citing improving but still elevated services inflation. The tone was modestly hawkish -- no imminent cuts, but the door is open for H2 2026 if disinflation continues.


### UK CPI (YoY) (2026-02-19)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Actual** | 3.1% |
| **Expected** | 2.8% |
| **Previous** | 2.9% |
| **Surprise** | above |

**Investor Impact:** UK inflation re-accelerated, complicating the Bank of England's rate-cut path. Sterling firmed on the print. EWU may benefit from a higher-for-longer BOE stance, but persistently high inflation is a risk to UK consumer spending.


### China Caixin Services PMI (2026-02-19)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Actual** | 52.3 |
| **Expected** | 51.8 |
| **Previous** | 52.0 |
| **Surprise** | above |

**Investor Impact:** China's service sector continues to expand at a healthy pace, supporting the domestic recovery narrative. Positive for EM-tilted ETFs (EEM, FXI) and commodity exporters.

## Positioning Tips

- The Euro weakened 0.82% against the USD: a headwind for unhedged European equity exposure (EFA, FEZ, EWG). Consider currency-hedged alternatives (HEDJ) or reduce European allocation until the Euro stabilises.
- The Japanese Yen weakened 1.53% against the USD: this reduces USD returns on unhedged Japan exposure (EWJ). Watch BOJ policy signals; any rate hike could trigger a sharp Yen reversal.
- Japan GDP contracted below expectations (-0.4% vs. 0.3%): growth weakness reduces the BOJ's appetite for further rate hikes. Consider reducing EWJ near-term; a dovish BOJ would weaken the Yen and compress USD returns on Japan equities.
- ECB Meeting Minutes were released: review the tone for signals on the rate path. A hawkish-leaning ECB supports EUR and could weigh on European bond proxies; a dovish lean favours EFA and FEZ through rate-cut expectations.
- UK CPI came in above expectations (3.1% vs. 2.8%): a higher-for-longer BOE rate path is now more likely. GBP may stay supported (positive for FXB), but rate pressure is a headwind for UK rate-sensitive sectors. Watch EWU for near-term volatility around the next BOE meeting.
- China Caixin PMI beat at 52.3 vs. 51.8 expected: domestic demand momentum supports EM risk-on positioning. Consider adding exposure via EEM or FXI on dips.
- BOJ Meeting Minutes on 2026-02-24: watch for any YCC or rate-hike signals. A hawkish surprise would likely strengthen the Yen sharply and create volatility in unhedged Japan exposure (EWJ). Carry-trade unwinding could ripple into EM assets.
- ECB Rate Decision on 2026-02-26: a key event for EUR and European equities. Reduce position size in EFA, FEZ, EWG ahead of the announcement; a surprise cut or hawkish hold could drive outsized FX and equity moves.
- Eurozone CPI Flash on 2026-02-27: a hot print would extend the ECB hold and pressure European bond proxies, while a soft print opens the door for H2 rate cuts, supportive of EFA, FEZ, and EUR-denominated duration.
