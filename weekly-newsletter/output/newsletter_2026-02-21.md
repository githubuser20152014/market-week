## Positioning Tips

- USD Index strengthened +0.72% this week -- a stronger dollar weighs on multinational earnings and commodities. Consider reducing exposure to export-heavy sectors and commodity ETFs (GLD, DJP).
- Housing Starts missed at 1.37M vs. 1.42M -- affordability pressure weighs on homebuilders (ITB, XHB). Watch mortgage rate trajectory before adding real estate exposure.
- Services PMI missed at 49.7 vs. 53.0 expected -- services sector contraction is a caution signal. Consider trimming consumer discretionary (XLY) and adding defensives (XLP, XLU).
- GDP release on 2026-02-26 -- a weak print could shift sentiment toward defensives (XLU, XLP); a strong beat supports risk-on positioning in cyclicals (XLY, XLI).
- PCE Price Index on 2026-02-27 -- the Fed's preferred inflation gauge. A hot print could reprice rate-cut expectations; consider hedging bond duration (TLT) and adding inflation protection (TIPS, GLD).
